### Explanation of Changes

1. **Timing Code**:
   - The program measures the total runtime by recording the start time at the beginning of the `main()` function and the end time just before the program ends.
   - The total time is then computed and printed in the `hh:mm:ss` format.

2. **Command Line Argument Handling**:
   - The script uses `get_input_args()` to handle command line arguments.
   - Added checks for the command line arguments using `check_command_line_arguments(in_arg)`.

3. **Pet Image Labels**:
   - `get_pet_labels(in_arg.dir)` is called to create a dictionary of pet image labels.
   - Added checks for the created labels using `check_creating_pet_image_labels(results)`.

4. **Image Classification**:
   - `classify_images(in_arg.dir, results, in_arg.arch)` is used to classify the images and compare the labels.
   - Added checks for the classification using `check_classifying_images(results)`.

5. **Adjusting Results**:
   - `adjust_results4_isadog(results, in_arg.dogfile)` adjusts the results to classify images as "dogs" or "not dogs".
   - Added checks for the adjustment using `check_classifying_labels_as_dogs(results)`.

6. **Calculating and Printing Results**:
   - `calculates_results_stats(results)` calculates the statistics.
   - Added checks for the statistics using `check_calculating_results(results, results_stats)`.
   - `print_results(results, results_stats, in_arg.arch, True, True)` prints the results.

Ensure the necessary functions are implemented in their respective files (`get_input_args.py`, `get_pet_labels.py`, `classify_images.py`, `adjust_results4_isadog.py`, `calculates_results_stats.py`, `print_results.py`) as the main function relies on these. You can use `sleep()` with different values to test the timing code as needed.
