Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the three model architectures did not classify Dog_01.jpg as the same breed.
Without the classifier labels, we can't determine if the classifications are the same or different.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the three model architectures did not classify Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed for each model.
without the classifier labels, we can't compare the classifications between Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified MTimage_01.jpg and gecko_02.jpg to not be dogs.

AlexNet:
MTimage_01.jpg: mtimage
gecko_02.jpg: gecko
VGG:
MTimage_01.jpg: mtimage
gecko_02.jpg: Gecko
ResNet:
MTimage_01.jpg: mtimage
gecko_02.jpg: Gecko


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:Without detailed classification results for each image and comparison across model architectures, it's challenging to determine which model architecture performed the best. However, based on the provided information, all three model architectures classified `Dog_01.jpg` and `Dog_02.jpg` as dogs, which indicates that they correctly identified the images as containing dogs. 

To make a more informed decision about the best model architecture, we would need to analyze the detailed classification results, including the predicted breeds and the correctness of classifications for non-dog images. Once these details are available, we can compare the performance of each model architecture across all images and select the one that demonstrates the highest accuracy and consistency.
